# Text_Generation_RNN
Textgen_rnn


Easily train your own text-generating neural network of any size and complexity on any text dataset with a few lines of code, or quickly train on a text using a pretrained model.

textgenrnn is a Python 3 module on top of Keras/TensorFlow for creating char-rnns, with many cool features:

1. A modern neural network architecture which utilizes new techniques as attention-weighting and skip-embedding to accelerate training and improve model quality.

2. Train on and generate text at either the character-level or word-level.

3. Configure RNN size, the number of RNN layers, and whether to use bidirectional RNNs.

4. Train on any generic input text file, including large files.

5. Train models on a GPU and then use them to generate text with a CPU.
